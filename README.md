## Introduction
In the banking industry, customer retention plays a pivotal role in maintaining a competitive edge. The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that effectively identifies customers at risk of churn and also by leveraging advanced analytics and machine learning techniques to empower the bank with proactive measures for customer retention.

Additionally, this analysis goes beyond churn prediction by delving into the identification of distinct churned segments. By understanding the unique characteristics and preferences of these segments, we can devise tailored retention strategies aimed at re-engaging and reactivating customers. This customer-centric approach will contribute to a sustainable customer base and bolster long-term profitability.
